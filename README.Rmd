> Use the R console as an interactive learning environment

The package `polyglot` helps you learn foreign language vocabulary or any [flashcards](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flashcard) using R as an interactive learning environment. The package implements a simplified version of the [SuperMemo-2](https://www.supermemo.com/en/archives1990-2015/english/ol/sm2) learning algorithm which optimizes intervals between repetitions, minimizes the time you spend on learning, and helps you achieve your learning goals in a more effective way.

### Installation

```{r eval=FALSE}
# install from Github
devtools::install_github("lgnbhl/polyglot")
```

### Create a spreadsheet to study

This package works with spreadsheets. You can create any spreadsheet to study in a [CSV format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) with a ```question``` column, an ```answer``` column and an ```hint/example``` column (optional). 

For example, you could make a spreadsheet of 30 basic expressions in French you want to study.

![](man/figures/screenshot1.png)

To try this spreadsheet, just type the following:

```{r eval=FALSE}
polyglot::get_examples()
```

This function copies CSV spreadsheets in your folder of reference, where you should add all the spreadsheets you want to study with polyglot.

To open this folder, simply run ```learn_dir()```.

```{r eval=FALSE}
polyglot::learn_dir()
```

To launch the learning environment, run the ```learn()``` function. Then choose in the interactive menu the file you want to study.

```{r eval=FALSE}
polyglot::learn() # to launch the interactive learning environment
```

The GIF below shows the learning of the CSV spreadsheet file ```French_30_Basic_Expressions.csv```.

### Learn with images

You can add images by putting the Web URL or the [full path](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Path_(computing)) of your images into the spreadsheet rows.

For example, you can study the locations, flags and capitals of [all the sovereign states](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_sovereign_states) around the world. Note that the images into the 3rd column ```Hint``` are displayed into your Web browser.

You could also memorize the recipes of the [74 official cocktails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_IBA_official_cocktails) of the International Bartenders Association (IBA).

The CSV spreadsheet files given as examples are [here](https://github.com/lgnbhl/polyglot/tree/master/inst/extdata).

Happy learning!
